EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The AGENT (Adaptive Genomic Evidence Network for Trials) platform addresses critical gaps in precision medicine implementation through an innovative AI-driven approach that integrates seamlessly with Epic EHR systems.

SPECIFIC AIMS
Aim 1: Develop and validate AI-powered genomic analysis algorithms aligned with CPIC guidelines
Aim 2: Implement Epic FHIR integration for real-time clinical decision support  
Aim 3: Deploy automated clinical trial matching for precision oncology patients
Aim 4: Evaluate clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness in real-world settings

SIGNIFICANCE
This work addresses the critical gap in precision medicine implementation by providing the first Epic-integrated platform for automated CPIC guideline implementation.

INNOVATION
- First-in-class Epic marketplace application for genomic medicine
