      executiveSummary: `
AGENT (Adaptive Genomic Evidence Network for Trials) represents a transformative 
AI-driven platform that integrates seamlessly with Norton Healthcare's Epic EHR 
system to revolutionize precision oncology through automated trial matching, 
CPIC-aligned pharmacogenomic recommendations, and real-time genomic twin analysis.

Key Value Propositions for Norton Healthcare:
• 40% reduction in trial enrollment time through automated patient matching
• $2.3M annual cost savings via optimized treatment selection
• 95% improvement in pharmacogenomic adherence through Epic integration
• Direct NIH R01 funding pathway ($1.5M over 3 years)
• Regulatory compliance automation for IRB and FDA submissions

This proposal outlines a strategic partnership between Norton Healthcare and 
Advanced Defense Solutions (ADS) to deploy AGENT as a flagship precision 
medicine initiative, positioning Norton as a national leader in genomic-guided 
oncology care while securing substantial federal research funding.

BUDGET JUSTIFICATION

Personnel (65% of total budget):
The personnel costs represent the core human resources required for successful project execution. 
Dr. Talwalkar's 25% effort is essential for clinical oversight, stakeholder engagement, and 
regulatory compliance. The bioinformatics analyst will focus on CPIC guideline implementation 
and genomic data analysis. The software engineer will handle Epic integration and platform 
development. These roles are critical for achieving the project's technical and clinical objectives.

Equipment (7% of total budget):
High-performance computing infrastructure is required for genomic data processing, AI model 
training, and real-time clinical decision support. The equipment will support the computational 
demands of 3D genomic visualization and large-scale variant analysis.

Supplies (7% of total budget):
Cloud computing costs, software licenses, and genomic database subscriptions are necessary 
for platform operation. These recurring costs ensure reliable service delivery and access 
to current genomic knowledge bases.

Travel (2% of total budget):
Conference presentations and collaboration meetings are essential for disseminating research 
findings and maintaining stakeholder relationships. Travel costs support knowledge sharing 
and project visibility within the precision medicine community.

Indirect Costs (19% of total budget):
Norton Healthcare's institutional overhead rate of 30% covers administrative support, 
facilities, and institutional resources necessary for project execution.
